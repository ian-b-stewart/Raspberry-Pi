   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

## Security Best Practices

When using this repository:

### Secrets Management

- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- The `Backup/secrets/` directory is gitignored for a reason
- Use the `.env.example` templates and create local `.env` files
- Rotate encryption passwords quarterly using `rotate-password.sh`

### File Permissions

Ensure proper permissions on sensitive files:

```bash
chmod 700 Backup/secrets/
chmod 600 Backup/secrets/backup.env
chmod 600 Backup/secrets/id_backup_ed25519
```

### SSH Keys

- Always use passphrase-protected SSH keys
- Use Ed25519 keys (generated by `setup.sh`)
- Restrict SSH key usage to specific hosts when possible

### Backup Security

- Secrets are encrypted with GPG AES-256 before transfer
- Use a dedicated backup user with minimal permissions on the remote server
- Regularly test your restore process
